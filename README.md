# Dictionaryopedia - Dictionary Web Application

The Dictionary Application was created for the Shecodes React Add-on Project

## Introduction

Dictionaryopdia is user-friendly dictionary app designed to help users look up the meanings of words. Built using React and free dictionary API.

[View the live project here.](https://dictionaryopedia.netlify.app/)

My approach for designing this dictionary application was to create it so that it is not only accessible to view on desktop but it is also mobile responsive. The applicaion is also accessible through a range of different devices.

## Deploy a project to Netlify

This site was deployed to Netlify. Plese follow these steps to deploy your site:

One way to get started deploying on Netlify is to use a Deploy to Netlify button to add a site.

1.Select the Deploy to Netlify button.

You will get directed to the Netlify app to create a new site. You should find the following page, asking you to connect to GitHub.

2.Select Connect to GitHub to authenticate. If you don’t already have a Netlify user account, you will get one as part of this process.

3.Select Save & Deploy. As well as creating a new site on Netlify, this process clones the demo project repository to your GitHub account so you can make your own changes later on.

You will be redirected to the Site overview page where you can check for the deploy in the Production deploys list.

You can also check that the repository has been cloned properly by selecting GitHub to navigate to your new repository on GitHub.

4.Once the deploy has finished building, you should get a production URL where you can access the website.

5.You can choose to customize the URL by changing the site’s name in the Netlify UI at Site settings > Site details > Site information.
